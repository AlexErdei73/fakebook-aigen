Do you still remember exactly the backend.js file?

Now I want you to clean it up a bit.
    1.I only want to see one line comments
    2.You only read the local storage in one function, which 
    updates the global variables you use for the (current) user 
    id and the token for the authorization of the requests
    3.Let's keep everything working just unify the code style 
    a bit for better readability
Thank you

Can I get the whole file?

The rest of the code please?

You forgot to provide the password reminder function for the 
signatures.

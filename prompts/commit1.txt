I have Fakebook, which is a Facebook clone social media app. It has a React-Redux front-end styled by Bootsrtrap 4.3 
and vanilla CSS. The back-end is Firebase. We have the backend.js file, which we work on the most. This connects the 
Firebase back-end to the actual front-end. We will completely rewrite it with certain reducers to switch to a 
completely different back-end solution.
The source code of the file:
// src/backend/backend.js

This is beautiful, but we won't use Typescript at all and we will go step by step in commits. It's going top be with 
some UI debugging about 40 commits job. We also won't use Redux middle-wares to handle HTTP requests. The first thing 
is to change this file that Firebase is going to be removed completely, but nothing should be broken in the front-end, 
so we should not get error messages.

Migration is successful, but it's better to put currentUser.isEmailVerified to true, so we can log in. The UI has a 
bug. It's in the UserAccount component. So the UserAccount.jsx slows down the browser. Here is the code:
// src/components/UserAccount.jsx

I still cannot log in

Now it's possible to log in. The index should be 0 unless second user exist with the exact same firstname and surname. 
In that case index counts the users already in the database with the same name and the new user gets this number as 
index. Now you can change the code.

Now we still have three problems with the UserAccount component.
    1. The Titlebar component covers the top of the HomePage component. This was no problem in the original version.
    2. If I register with the same name (both firstname and surname are the same) this registration in not case 
    sensitive. The name should be the exact same when we introduce the index.
    3. If the user has index = 1 the profileLink is going to contain the last .1 part a lot of times, 
    like .1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 and so on. This is very bad and cause a bug.

Our previous conversation revolved around improving the Fakebook application, a Facebook clone with a React-Redux 
frontend and a Magic backend. We addressed several critical bugs and implemented improvements across different 
components:

    1.We fixed the current user's profile display by ensuring that the Redux slice receives a fully mapped user 
    object immediately after login or session restoration.

    2.We modified the post creation mechanism to work with the Magic backend, ensuring that posts are correctly sent 
    to the server and handled by SignalR updates.

    3.We resolved an issue with the Profile component where the user profile could not be rendered if the users were 
    still loading or the username was invalid. We implemented a more robust method of resolving and displaying user 
    profiles using useMemo and adding proper fallback rendering.

    4.We added missing handler functions for photo selection and upload modals to ensure smooth user interactions 
    when changing profile and cover pictures.

Throughout the process, we focused on maintaining the existing code structure, minimizing changes, and ensuring that 
the modifications were surgical and targeted. The goal was to improve the application's reliability, user experience, 
and compatibility with the Magic backend without introducing unnecessary complexity.

It's working but I have a bug. Can you please save the context and start a new chat?

The profile component does not show the photos and the posts of the current user for the first loading of the app. 
When I refresh the browser these are visible again. The problem is just with the current user.

We do not use Redux thunk for the requests. Here is the backend.js file:
// src/backend/backend.js
Here are the two important Redux slices:
// src/features/currentUser/currentUserSlice.js
// src/features/users/usersSlice.js

Can I get just the beginning of the code to copy in?

Can I get the rest of it too?

There are too many details in the code, what would make it stop working if we tried. Can instead give me a step by 
step debugging instruction to identify the cause?

I solved the issue with the Redux dev tools. The users state contains everything apart from the posts and photos of 
the current user. The reason is that this is getting updated by the usersUpdated slice when it already contains 
partial information about the current user. This reducer did not contain the lines, which update photos and posts 
fields.

Not exactly. Do you want to see the code?

// src/features/usersSlice/usersSlice.js
// src/utils/mapRestUser.js

The simplest solution is removing the openSocket() call from the setAuth function. I needed to put in two places 
right after the bootstrapSession call in both signInUser and subscribeAuth function. In this case no other 
modification is needed and everything works.

Interestingly if I move the openSocket() call at the end of the bootstrapSession, current user stays offline in the 
UI if the user logs in.

It's not working this way. If I have just loaded in the site and I log in, I will stay offline.

The simpler second solution is perfect.

// The code was still buggy and I decided to add the two extra lines to the usersUpdated reducer to update photos 
// and posts too.

The current form of backend.js file, which works just fine is the 
following:
// src/backend/backend.js
Now we are making the pictures load in. GET image is the request 
with the same base URL. It takes two query parameters. The first 
is the folder, which is the user_id of the user, who uploaded the 
image, the second the filename, which is the original name of the 
uploaded file. File uploading does a little image optimization. 
It changes the format to 800px width and keeps aspect ratio. It 
also changes the file type to png. We need to rewrite the 
StorageImage.jsx component. It will return an image element where 
the src attribute is the return value of the GET image request, 
the alt property an empty string, since images here just 
decoration. You can remove a kind of caching mechanism, which 
used Redux too. Let me know, which file can be removed. The 
current code of the component is:
// src/components/StorageImage.jsx

We see only placeholder pictures. We need now populate in the 
usersSlice and the currentUserSlice the photos field too. What 
do you need to modify for this?

We have got to the loading state, because some function failed. 
Fix it
// prompts/images/commit6-GETimage-request-error-1.png

OK, I see the problem now clearly. The photos array stores 
objects. These have only one field, the filename.

The profilePictureURL and backgroundPictureURL fields contain 
the folder with the filename

No. We do not need to call addPath for the profilePictureURL and 
the backgroundPictureURL and we only call it for the element of 
photos array. It keeps it simpler.

The GET image request has to get the token for authorization too, 
just like all the requests in this back-end.

What do you think about storing the userID and token in global 
variables in the backend.js file and deal with the requests only 
there. So StorageImage could import the function there and no 
need to always read local storage before every request. Is it 
better idea?

In this app there is nothing in the local storage, when the user 
is logged out. So we need ti initialize the variables when the 
user logs in. This way we can avoid issues. Do it like that.

Give me full bakend.js code please

What's after line 265?

Give me StorageImage.jsx too

I can only see the placeholder images everywhere. What's wrong 
in the StorageImage code?

No. The requests get the token fine. Every image is a child of 
the UserAccount component, which only renders if we have a logged 
in user, so a token. The MIME type header is not right. The 
request returns a png image from the server. It should not have 
body part?

My fault, the filenames are webp, because the back-end uses webp 
format. We need to change the filenames, but to webp. I gave you 
wrong information.

We can remove the token, because this endpoint is not protected. 
The folder has to contain the fakebook word, so 
folder=fakebook/{userID}. I fixed the code, would you like to see 
it?

I think there is no difference between my version and yours 
regarding in the url variable. What do you think?

I tried it and it works fine now.

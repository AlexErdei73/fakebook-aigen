The last fix before deployment is the online status, when someone 
closes the browser window, without signing out. Although we 
handle the event which is visibility change to send the request, 
the browser closes before the request is sent. Fix this in the 
backend.js file and remove the unnecessary before unload listener 
from the UserAccount component.

How about if someone just hides the browser window on mobile for 
example?
